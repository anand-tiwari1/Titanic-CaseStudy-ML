# Titanic Survival Prediction Data Analysic 

## Introduction
Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger.

Given a passenger aboard the Titanic, this is a prediction whether or not this passenger has survived? In other words, a trained machine learning model to learn the relationship between passenger features and their survival outcome and susbsequently make survival predictions on passenger data that the model has not been trained on. This is a binary classfication problem in machine learning

## Data description
Below are the description of the features in the data:
- Survival: 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived
- Pclass: Ticket class where 1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class.
- Sex: Male or female
- Age: Age in years, fractional if less than 1
- SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Passenger ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Point of embarkation where C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
